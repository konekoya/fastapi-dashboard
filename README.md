# FastAPI Dashboard

## About

The web UI for the [fast-api](https://github.com/konekoya/fast-api) repo. The fast api was originally a [Python API course](youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA) that I took from freecodecamp while I was learning Python development. I then turned it into a side project and is currently adding more features to it.
